# Quadratics

======

This is just a simple application that takes the numbers for "a, b and c" in the quadratic formula as command line arguments.

### What to do?

------

1. Fork the repo.
2. Compile the main.c, iomethods.h and iomethods.c file by using `gcc -o 'name-of-program' main.c iomethods.h iomethods.c` (mac) or use other methods to compile.
3. Run the program by doing `./'name-of-program'`.
4. There are two options now, input the numbers for 'a', 'b' and 'c' in that order for the arguments e.g `./'name-of-program' 1 2 -8` or enter `./'name-of-program'` and then complete walkthrough.
5. Using the example above the ouput should be `Answer is: 2 or -4`.

(To quit the program type `ctrl-c` (mac))
